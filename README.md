# A Numerical Library
A Lightweight Numerical Library in Python used to integrate ODE's
and do various numerical operations

## Cool ODE Example:
```
$ python3 systems_example.py
```

## Other Usages
There are plenty of tools in `ode/numerical_lib.py` such as cubic\_splines, nevilles method, Horner Polynomials etc. Take a dig and use whatever you think is nice. This library is very vanilla, so I didn't optimize the code (if I did, I wouldn't write it in python), but what this library has over others is readability and understandability for when developers want to implement specialized functions themselves in another language. 

Some day, I might port this to C but for now, it's meant to be reference material.
